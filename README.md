# PythonDatabaseLinker
Automated tool for linking urban-scale buildings data from a postgreSQL database to CitySim solver (EPFL) and storing simulation results back on the database. The DBLinker uses parallel computing to minimize the time needed to process big amounts of data.

This project was developed as part of my master's thesis based on the java version by jkaempf.
