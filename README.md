# PythonDatabaseLinker
Automated tool for linking urban-scale buildings data from a postgreSQL database to CitySim solver (EPFL) and storing simulation results back on the database. The DBLinker uses parallel computing to minimize the time needed to process big amounts of data.

This project was developed as part of my master's thesis based on the java version by jkaempf.

# Who's this project for?
I've published this script mainly for students who are using CitySim for their thesis/semester projects. However, anyone is free to use it and to modify it according to his needs. If this script helped you in some way, feel free to mention it in your work. Also, any feedback is highly appreciated.

# Can I use it out of the box?
Yes, you can, provided that your database's structure matches mine. In most situations, however, this won't be the case and you'll have to make some minor changes to the code and adapt it to your needs. Feel free to contact me if you need some help.

# Is there any guide/documentation?
At present, no. However, I'm planning to write a short guide somewhere in the future.
